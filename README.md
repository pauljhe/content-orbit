# ContentOrbit

## Project Overview
ContentOrbit is a cloud-based content aggregation platform that automatically collects, processes, and stores media content such as YouTube videos, news articles, and RSS feeds based on **user-defined preferences**.

Users can configure their own content sources, categories, and keywords, allowing ContentOrbit to operate as a flexible and extensible media monitoring system rather than a hobby-specific tool.

The project is designed to demonstrate real-world cloud engineering and full-stack development skills, including event-driven data ingestion, ETL pipelines, infrastructure as code, and a React-based dashboard for content visualization.

## Key Features
- User-configurable content sources (YouTube channels, RSS feeds, news APIs)
- Automated data ingestion using AWS Lambda
- Raw data storage in Amazon S3
- Data transformation and structured storage in Amazon RDS
- React-based dashboard for browsing and filtering content
- Optional notification system (Slack / Email)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Python (AWS Lambda)
- Cloud: AWS S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch
- Infrastructure: Terraform
- Notifications: Slack / Email

## Project Goals
- Build a production-style cloud data pipeline
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS serverless architecture
- Create a strong portfolio project for Cloud Engineer / Full-Stack roles
- Follow best practices in security (IAM), scalability, and maintainability
